Project CSC207:Project phase 2

This program is about a transit system simulation that tracks and calculates fares for anyone who uses a travel card
to enter and exit the transit system.

Getting Started:
Please sign up both admin user account(the admin user code is required for sign up, which is group0127)
 and card user account.
 The system is close in default, you need to login to admin user account to open the system before card users can use the
 transit system.
 Also you need to login to the card user account -> Manage my card -> add card, so card users can access to further
 functionality.

When user tap in or tap out on a transit system, they need to enter the date, time, cardID and station/stop manually,
due to we do not have a card sensor as in the reality.
